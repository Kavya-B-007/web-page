    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="card">
        Hello! I'm Kavya B — an enthusiastic engineering student passionate about technology, creativity, and community development.  

I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering at SACS MAVMM Engineering College with a CGPA of 8.5. Along with academics, I actively participate in technical learning, volunteering activities, and leadership programs.

As an NSS volunteer, I have organized medical camps, awareness surveys, and community development programs. I also attended the National Integration Camp in Assam, representing my college and state.

I enjoy working on real-world projects that create impact — including initiatives like improving parent and community engagement in education, dengue and tuberculosis awareness surveys, and medical outreach programs.

My interests include Web Development, UI/UX Design, Social Impact Projects, Writing, and Continuous Learning. I love challenging myself, exploring new skills, and growing both personally and professionally.
